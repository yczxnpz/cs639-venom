As many people are desired to witness the falling of meteoroids, this project will use the data collected by NASA to discuss over the various factors that influence the occurrence of such phenomena. The main method used in this project will be different visualizations, which includes a variety of graphs as well as interactive figures. In the end, correlations between geographical distribution and meteoroids and other similar relationship will be investigated.</p></p></div><div class="idyll-scroll" id="idyll-scroll-0" style="position:relative"><div class="idyll-scroll-graphic" style="height:100vh;top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:auto;width:100%;transform:translate3d(0, 0, 0);z-index:-1"><div style="width:0;position:absolute;left:0;right:0;top:50%;transform:translateY(-50%)"><div><img src="static/images/m.svg" class="bar" idyll="[object Object]"/></div></div></div><div class=" idyll-text-container"><div class="idyll-scroll-text"><div class="idyll-step "><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>For centuries, meteoroids have long been seen as special symbolic significance. To witness the falling of meteoroids can be an aspirational experience for many astrophiles, and can also be of great value for astronomical or geological study. In this project, data collected by the meteoritical society is mainly used for visualization. The dataset records the meteorites that have fallen to earth from outer space in recent tens of years. To implement the visualization, a cleaning is necessary as the first step. Then the connection between observed falls of meteorites and different data categories could be illustrated.

    <br/>1) The difference of geographical distribution of observed falls and that of found meteorites.
    <br/>2) The differences over time in the class of meteorites that have fallen to earth.
    </p></p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p><h2 id="the-narrative-to-convey">THE NARRATIVE TO CONVEY</h2><p>In general, the narrative that this project is going to convey includes these few parts:
    <br/>1)  Go through the meteorite dataset provided by NASA, and view the data classes or categories.
    <br/>2)	Clean the raw data, particularly those seemingly meaningful but redundant ones.
    <br/>3)	Then start to explore the possible correlations between each feature and the corresponding meteorite’s fall, where the clues regarding meteorites’ fall are gradually unconcealed.
    <br/>4)	Ultimately, the phenomenon mentioned in overall goals will be explained.

    <br/>
    As most data visualization project would do, we thoroughly checked the entire dataset and remove redundant data or fill in missing data. We have found that many meteorites landing sites are sharing the same name, hence we designated distinct numbers per meteorite name, this helps to indicate how frequently a place would be hit by meteorites.
    </p></p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p><em>Geological distribution</em>
    <br/>
    In this sub-section, we continue to explore the observed falls of meteorites and those meteorites that actually have been found. Because there exist quite a lot of cases where meteorites fell down without being witnessed. For this visualization purpose, we used heatmap to represent their geological distributions. After comparing several different features, we occasionally discovered an interesting fact. Unlike what we had assumed before, the geological distribution of meteorites that were witnessed was highly correlated to that of population density, rather than that of meteorites found. This is what has not been expected before.

    <br/>
    Now we start to investigate the changes over time in terms of the classes of meteorites fell to earth. To begin with, we at first inspected all the recorded classes for meteorites and the corresponding frequency of each class. 
    <br/><figure><img src="static/images/table1.jpg"/><p class="figP">Sample Meteorite Classes</p></figure><br/>
    For those recorded classes, we only kept the ones which had a relatively high frequency. Rather than directly using their astronomical code, we decided to apply the systematical classification on meteorites, which would make more sense and easy to recognize. By observing we found that the classes that started with H, LL or L were significantly more frequent than other types. Therefore, we reformatted the class list, and grouped each meteorite as its corresponding type.

The project has basically delved into two aspects: one was the difference in geographical distribution of observed falls and that of found meteorites, the other one was the differences over time in the class of meteorites that have fallen to earth. The implementation of visualizations included histograms, bar plots, heatmaps and other complex interactive visualizations. During the exploration of meteorites data, we have found that the geological distribution of meteorites that were witnessed falling had a high correlation with world population density, which seemed surprising. Moreover, the major difficulty when investigating the fallings of different classes was to classify meteorites into families rather than using their original code.
